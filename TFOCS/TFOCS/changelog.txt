Jan 12 2012, v1.1 
    User guide updated.
    Changes to code:
    New:
        linop_fft.m         FFT and its transpose. Supports sub-sampling.
        test_proxPair.m     Tests whether f and fDual are really duals. Not yet
            documented in user guide, but see the help text.
        solver_sLP_box.m    LP with equality and box constraints
        test_sBPDN_nonnegative.m    Tests BPDN using x >= 0 constraint.
        image_denoising_withSPOT.m  An example of image denoising
            and using the SPOT toolbox. The helper file "plotNow.m" is
            also new, and allows you to watch a movie in real-time of
            the iterates. Also shows how to use reweighting.
        prox_l1pos.m        proximity operator for ||x||_1 restricted to x >= 0
        test_SVM.m          demo with support vector machines and hinge-loss
        test_complicatedUsage.m     demo with several matrix variables and
            other complicated terms
        test_all.m          runs all small scale examples
        linop_reshape.m     reshapes input (an extension of linop_vec). Thanks
            to Graham Coleman for contributing.
        tfocs.m             "debug" option added to main tfocs routine

    Bug fixes:
        solver_sSDP.m       fixed bug, thanks to Brian Borchers.  
        prox_hingeDual.m    fixed NaN bug
        continuation.m      fixed bug for case when there are multiple matrix
            variables, and for 3D arrays (thanks to Graham Coleman).
        prox_spectral.m     fixed bugs
        test_sTV_largescale.m   fixed myAwgn() bug (thanks to Matthew Suttinger)
        linop_stack.m       fixed bug that occurs when domain is a set of
            matrices rather than vectors; thanks to Graham Coleman for discovering.
        all solvers:        fixed a bug with variable "L" that arose whenever
            there is a function called "L.m" in the path (for example, WaveLab has
            such a function).
        tfocs_LLM.m         fixed bug that occurs when restart is used
        tfos_initialize.m   fixed bug for strong convexity case when Lexact not
            specified
        prox_boxDual.m      fixed bug with bounds were not scalars
        proj_l2.m           fixed bug for q ~= 1 case
        proj_0.m            fixed bug for non-constant offsetsl thanks to Graham
            Colemen

    Improvements:
        tfocs.m             allows new "debug" flag that gives more verbose
            information, useful when debugging
        tfocs_inizialize.m  gives more useful error message when sizes are
            incorrect
        tfocs_iterate.m     Improved performance for stopCrit = 3
        tfocs_iterate.m     Now supports 'printStopCrit' to display progress of
            whatever value is used to determine the stopping criteria
        linop_test.m        Supports conjugate-symmetric complex inputs/outputs
        test_sBPDN_withContinuation.m         Updated 
        solver_sBP.m        Supports non-negativity constraints
        solver_sBPDN.m      Supports non-negativity constraints
        tfocs_AT.m          Now includes cntr_reset field, which explicitly
            recalculates some quantities every so often to avoid accumulation
            of roundoff error.
        proj_boxDual.m --> prox_boxDual.m   to have more consistent naming.
        proj_l2.m           handles diagonal scaling term; this feature is
            experimental and uses a 1D optimization routine. It should
            be efficient for N <= 2^18 at least
        prox_l2.m           same experimental modification as in proj_l2.m
        linop_scale.m       allows user to specify size explicitly, if desired
        prox_hinge.m and prox_hingeDual.m   allow more general form with "y"
            variable
        example_{LMI, LinearProgram, SDP} renamed to test_{LMI, LinearProgram,
            SDP }

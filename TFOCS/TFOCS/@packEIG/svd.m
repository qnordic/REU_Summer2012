%function [ s, U, V ] = svd( x )

% Stephen's comments:
%   since we are overloading this, I think we need to follow
%   Matlab's conventions for their svd function.
%   In particular, output is either S = ... or [U,S,V] = ...
%   and not [S,U,V] = ...
% Also, we should make S either a vector or diagonal matrix
%   in the same way that svd does
%   (e.g. S = ... is a vector, [U,S,V] = ... means S is a diagonal
%       matrix ).
